## Week 6.

The assigment was to make a survey to practice using state in React. My survey is about finding out which character from "The Lord of the Rings" that you are. 

## What the instructions were: 

✓ Your survey should consist of at least 3 questions.

✓ At least one question should use radio buttons.

✓ At least one question should use a select dropdown.

✓ There should be a submit button. When pressed your app should hide the input form and show a summary of the user's submissions.

✓ Your site should follow accessibility guidelines



## The problem

I had some struggle in the beginning to decide and commit to a structure with what should be devided in to componants or not, but in the end I think it turned out nice.
Which character you become is now only depening on the answer of the first question. If I had more time i would want the Character you become to be based of all the answers.
